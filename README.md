# hUH
This repository hosts the code for hyperspectral Unmixing Hierarchies (hUH). Unmixing is a technique for partitioning a spectral image which allows for mixed pixels, and which can be related directly back to the original data.
This repository extends the hierarchichal NMF based clustering of Gillis et al 2014 in order to allow for mixed pixels.
